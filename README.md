##Challenges/Future Development
 The biggest challenge this project faced was the time limit. Within the given 2 hours, I was able to present all the required data, but all of it is hard coded into the HTML and does not use jQuery. Given additional time, I would have liked to abstract out all the text and image links in a JS object, which could then be dynamically added to the DOM. This would DRY up much of the HTML code.
